        <h3>About Chip </h3>

        <p>
            I grew up in Cedar Falls, a town in northeast Iowa. I am currently 22 years old and in my last semester of college at the University of Iowa. I am pursuing my degrees in BBA Business Analytics & Information Systems, and BBA Management & Entrepreneurship. I am currently looking for jobs for when I graduate in May of 2023, but have a desire to move to Des Moines, IA after graduation.

          I found my love for analytics and statistics as a child. I remember always loving maps and looking at where all the cities were in Iowa and how far away they were from my hometown. I have also always had a love for sports analytics, especially football. I loved looking at player stats and where all the players went to college and their stats in college. These childhood memories is what started my love for analytics and drove me to pursue a degree in it.
