# Final-Project
This repository holds the current code for my personal portfoilo I created as a final project during spring 2023 semester in BAIS:3300 - Digital Product Management.

What did I learn?
* I downloaded an HTML template file to quickly stand up an attractive portfolio web site.
* I edited the template to include my details, to add features that were not previously present, and to remove existing template features I did not plan to use.
* The files were validated to HTML5 and CSS3 stanards.
* The website was validated to WCAG2.1, level AA standards for accessibility.
* The website was deployed to Microsoft Azure cloud services as a static web application.
* The website was configured with a custom domain purchased and configured at NameCheap.

Installation Instructions:
1. Clone this repository
2. This project uses static HTML so files can be opened locally by double clicking the .html files.
